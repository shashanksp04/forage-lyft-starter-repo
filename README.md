# Lyft Backend Software Engineering Simulation

## Overview

This project is a part of Backend Software Engineering Simulation for Lyft's rental department. The primary focus areas include:

- **Software Architecture**: Designing and implementing a robust and scalable architecture.
- **Refactoring**: Improving the structure and readability of a messy, unfinished codebase.
- **Unit Testing**: Creating tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before the actual implementation to guide the development process.

## Development Approach

  ### Software Architecture
  
  The application is designed using a modular approach, separating concerns into different modules for models, services, and utilities. This ensures a clean and maintainable codebase.
  
  ### Refactoring
  
  The existing codebase was refactored to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. This involved restructuring classes, functions, and modules, as well as improving variable names and documentation.
  
  ### Unit Testing
  
  Comprehensive unit tests were written for all critical components of the application. This ensures that any changes made to the codebase do not introduce new bugs.
  
  ### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  
  A TDD approach was employed, where tests were written before the actual implementation. This helps in identifying the requirements clearly and ensures that the code meets the specified functionality.
